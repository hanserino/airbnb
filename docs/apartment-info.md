Hi Alice! 

Since I'm traveling and won't be available at all times when you use the apartment I've created this document to answer (hopefully) all of your possible questions. 

## Wi-Fi
Name: `Greipfrukt`

Password: `Yolo1234`

## In case of emergency
- Fire department: `111`
- Police: `112`
- Ambulance: `113`
- Me/apartment owner (Hans Kristian): `+47 928 41 558`
- My helpful neighbour Jamila: `‭+47 465 12 440‬`

## Other notes: 
The **fire extinguisher** is located underneath the kitchen table and the smoke detector is in the ceiling in the kitchen. If it goes off and you're just making some food and there isn't a fire, pull out the battery and open up the window to let the smoke out. Put the battery back when the smoke is gone. 

## Kitchen
Use whatever kitchen tools you want. There isn't a dishwasher, so please clean the dishes before you leave. 

## Food
There is a dedicated shelf in the fridge for you labeled with *AirBnb*. Feel free to eat whatever I've put there for you. 

There is also a box on the kitchen counter dedicated for you. 

## Stuff in the apartment
Use my stuff as you like. If you use the record player or speakers, turn it down after 11 o'clock.

## When you leave
1. Put the key in the mailbox labeled with `Hans Kristian Smedsrød`.
2. Dump used towels in the laundry box.
3. Let me know that you've left.

## Getting around town
If you're going downtown, the easiest is to walk up to the bus stop (100m) and take line `31` towards Fornebu or Snarøya. The central station is called `Jernbanetorget`. The bus leaves approx every 10 minutes, so don't bother checking the schedule.

When returning, your bus stop is called `Aker Sykehus`.

Bus tickets have to be bought through the [Ruter App](https://ruter.no/en/buying-tickets/mobile-ticket-app/). This ticket is also valid for the tram and subway.
